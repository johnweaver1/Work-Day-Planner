# Work-Day-Planner
## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events during a 9-5 work day. This is saved in the local storage of the computer you are using. For past events the calender will be colored grey, for current events it will be red, and for future events it will be green. This app runs in the browser using dynamically updated features using HTMl and CSS powered by JQuery.
